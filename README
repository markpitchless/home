Putting my home dir (profile) under git control.

== Bootstrap ==

1st time install into a new home directory.

```
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markpitchless/home/master/bin/nfa-bootstrap
chmod a+x nfa-bootstrap
./nfa-bootstrap
```

Manages home dir but doesn't have the git repo there (after extensive use having a ``~/.git`` is bad idea, not quite as bad as you might think, but don't do it ;-), instead that goes in ``~/.nfa``, with shell hooks and configs symlinked. Use the bootstrap script for that initial setup.

== Updates ==

``
cd ~/.nfa
git pull
nfa-provision
``

== Home Linking

Nfa sym links files and folders from `~/.nfa/home/` to `~`, your home
directory. This is so you can keep them under version control in your nfa
repository but still have them in their expected locations on the system. Your
editors and tools rc files are what this is for, e.g. a version controlled
`.screenrc` in `~/.nfa/home/.screenrc` gets symlinked to `~/.screenrc` when
nfa-infect runs, which also happens during a bootstrap. Now running screen will
use your config, you can edit in the normal location (`vim ~/.screenrc`) but
commit and push your changes to your repo so they appear in all your other
logins after an `nfa-pull`.
