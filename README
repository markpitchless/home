* Mark Pitchless Home *
***********************

Putting my home dir (profile) under git control.

https://github.com/markpitchless/home

== Bootstrap ==

1st time install into a new home directory.

```
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markpitchless/home/master/bin/nfa-bootstrap
chmod a+x nfa-bootstrap
./nfa-bootstrap
```

Manages home dir but doesn't have the git repo there (after extensive use having a ``~/.git`` is bad idea, not quite as bad as you might think, but don't do it ;-), instead that goes in ``~/.nfa``, with shell hooks and configs symlinked. Use the bootstrap script for that initial setup.

== Updates ==

``
cd ~/.nfa
git pull
nfa-provision
``
