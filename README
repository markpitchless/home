* Mark Pitchless Home *

Putting my home dir (profile) under git control.

https://github.com/markpitchless/home

== Setup ==

Want this to go into home, so need to be careful to copy the dot files
properly. e.g. for user in /home/mda

 git clone git@github.com:markpitchless/home.git /tmp/mda
 cp -a /tmp/mda /home
 rm -rf /tmp/mda
