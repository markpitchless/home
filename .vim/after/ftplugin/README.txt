Custom filetype settings go here. The file should be named <filetype>.vim e.g.
use perl.vim for perl settings.

NB: The global plugin ($VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/*.vim) will be run first so these
settings override any settings there. To make settings before the global ones
and thus potentially have them overwritten use ~/.vim/ftplugin/*.vim
